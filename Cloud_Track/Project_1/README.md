# Project 1 - Deploy Static Website on AWS

**TLDR:** the project is described step by step on Udacity.There are no much todo, its more about following all the steps described on the project page.

The whole project has two major intentions to implement:

- Hosting a static website on S3 and
- Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.
