The first project is Pitch a Product Vision. For this project, you'll have to choose from the following scenarios:

Option 1: Kaiser Permanente is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity and improve on healthy habits. While the overall goal is improved patient satisfaction and well being, the specific financial goal is reduced cost by emphasizing improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. Overall, KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes.
Your team is tasked with researching the potential costs, features and benefits of a mobile application that communicates with KP patients and helps them improve on healthy habits.

Option 2: Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times. The long term goal is that these delivery robots will navigate sidewalks fully autonomously. But initially, there may be times when manual intervention will be required.
Your team has been tasked with building a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).

Option 3: Amazon is the world leader in self-publishing for books. They would now like to explore entering into another self-publishing media vertical and are considering either self-published videos or self-published music.
Your team is tasked with research these two verticals and deciding which one seems like a better opportunity based on existing competition, synergy with other Amazon offerings, ease of building an offer and potential revenues.

Option 4: LinkedIn is trying to expand its job market offerings by creating an app that will recommend the best jobs to recent college graduates based on their skills and preferences.
Your team has been tasked with researching the market for this offering, the kinds of data needed, how to connect this with other LinkedIn offerings and how to best monetize it.
